Ableton Live - MIDI Remote Scripts 

Contents: Scripts for creating custom MIDI Remote Scripts for Ableton Live.
(Known) Working versions: 9.2 and above (currently 9.7.1)

In-depth video tutorial: https://youtu.be/IgKwcCJsoz4
Use this code for Push 2 User Mode (yet to confirm if working with Push 1, will update soon):

NOTE: I won’t reply here, YouTube is the best place to make comments about the code or suggest changes. 

Additional:

To change the size of the track selection box (coloured box in Session view), edit CONTROL_RING_WIDTH and CONTROL_RING_HEIGHT in MIDI_Map.py

Lastly, don’t forget to add or remove rows/columns for SCENELAUNCH and CLIPNOTEMAP from MIDI_Map.py if you didn't use the full 8x8 grid.
